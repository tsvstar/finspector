	--> archives INCREMENTAL (to decrease storage):
		** based on '>' (store at header? as "<fname_of_db") -- processed by wrapper ( recursively load it on load; preload base dir and make comparision for another one )
		* simpliest -> completely replace whole dir list (say '+dir' and complete its nonrecursive list, '~dir'=delete)
		* more complex [not sure that better] - more operational [move dir there, move file, only that file, that files were delete,etc]

	--> simple segment:
		* completely text file in utf-8.
		* firstline is "FILE_INSPECTOR_SEGMENTED_DB"
		* [+-]db_relative_path\t[dir1|dir2|...]

		* [not sure - harder to configure] other lines are JSON: { 'db_fname': 
						{
						  'include': ['dir1', 'dir2',...]
						  'exclude': []
						}

=== DB TYPES ===
    SEGMENTED DB (config PREFIX-> NAME )
    ASOF DB (snapshot for given date)
    ?? ~.intermediary -- half scanned( not needed: fsystem scan is quick, than absent md5 is just empty)

=== DB FORMAT ===
   HEADER
       tsv@f_inspector|{main|intermediary|segmented}|asof_decimal_tstamp|area\n\n

   LINES (ignore empty):
       --DIR--|name|hex_hmtime|b64_md5??|optional_val
       type|name\t|hex_mtime|dec_size\t|b64_md5|optional_val

 filename +.asofDECTIMESTAMP       -- snapshot of state for exact asof day
 filename +.~intermediary          -- snapshot of state


=== HOW TO USE ===
finspector.py [--options..] command

 options:
   --asof "datestr"
   --where "starts"   (accumulative option)
   --config "file.cfg"
   --db  "file.db"
   --dirty	        (update only filesystem. so use name+size+mtime)
   --update		(update fsystem and md5 first)
   --create_asof
   -o/--opt [OPTION=VALUE]
   --stderr             (valuable output at stdout, progress at stderr)
   --silent
   --noprogress		(no progress)

 commands:
   find      grep
   findpreg  perl regexp
   update    [where,..]
   check     [where,..]          -- check integrity of files (by md5 hash)
   dupes     [where,..]          -- find duplicates (try to collapse to whole dir)
   changes   [where,..]          -- find what was changed (since last or given asof) (with or without update)
   backup    config              -- do backup changes based on config
   size      [where [size300M]]  -- report about space usage (anything>n%)
   remember  --delete [where]	 -- remember list of files which are copies from somewhere
   restore   filelist where	 -- restore files by list from their sources
   rs				 -- make read-solomon keys
